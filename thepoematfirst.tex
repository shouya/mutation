\begin{verse}
\textsf {\large I'm still a human, the cosmos wants us change.\\
I'm still a human, I got the base-thoughts of the all.\\
I'm still a human, my thoughts and physical are all belong to myself.\\
In theory I can nirvana, but I didn't.\\
That's because I still a human.\\
Even I don't have pain of my physical.\\
But also let me unbearable.
}
\end{verse}
